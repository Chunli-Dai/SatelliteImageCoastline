# SatelliteImageCoastline
The code is to retrieve coastlines using multi-spectral satellite imagery by WorldView-2 and -3 satellites. The basic algorithm is the popular NDWI formula. This code focuses on the mosaicking of coastlines from all scenes, the detection of clouds over water, and the coastline detection eventually based on water probability.
